# Beat the Box (v3.10.1)

Fixes & tweaks:
- Tap ANY face-up pile to select it (per-pile selection bug fixed)
- Thick highlight border shows the currently selected pile
- Controls under grid, mobile-safe layout, and longer animations kept
- "Same" = replace with same-value card + PUSH revive (or +1 bonus life)
